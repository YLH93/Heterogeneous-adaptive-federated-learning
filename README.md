# Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning, especially in healthcare and biomedical applications. However, traditional FL methods often assume that data across clients are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which is rarely true in real-world scenarios. This repository implements a heterogeneity-aware federated learning framework that addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity while preserving privacy.

# The key contributions of this work include:

Gatekeeping for Heterogeneity: Theoretical bounds and empirical guidelines to determine the validity of federated inference in the presence of heterogeneity.

HSD-ODAL and HSD-ODAL-MEM Algorithms: Novel algorithms for heterogeneity-aware federated learning, applicable to logistic and count data models.

Empirical Validation: Extensive simulations and real-world case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
